/******************************************************************************
Name: TestDriver.cpp
Des: This program is designed to test the base functionality of the List ADT
implemented as an ordered linked list.  The program will obtain its data from
a textfile of strings (one string per line).  The user will be queried for the
name of the text file; if it does not exist the program will exit.  Otherwise,
the program will build an ordered link list using a List object.  If the build
is successful, a menu will be provided for the user allowing he/she to delete,
edit, or print the list.  When the program is over, the memory allocated for
all the nodes in the linked list will be released back to the system. This test
program will also test for memory leaks by using the header vld.h. If memory
leaks exist, a report will be generated at the end of execution noting what
memmory locations were not deallocated.
