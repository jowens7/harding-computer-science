# TINY Machine Language

1. Using your favorite text editor, write a TINY machine language program (using the format shown in the example below) that will read 3 integers from the keyboard and then display their product on the screen.
 
2. Using your favorite text editor, write a TINY machine language program that will print the integers 1 through 5 on a single line on the screen (no spaces).  You may assume that the addresses 100 and 101 each contain the value 00001.  If you need other data stored, add a note that details the data values and addresses that you are using.
 
Recall that the first TINY machine instruction MUST be located at address 000.
 
The following machine language program is provided as an example to illustrate the format that should be used for this assignment.  This example program will read 2 integers from the keyboard and then display their sum.
